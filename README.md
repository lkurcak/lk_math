# lk_math
Collection of reusable mathematical tools.

## Disclaimer
This library serves for my personal use.
It is a work in progress, not documented and the API might not be user-friendly.

Some usage can be seen in [my solutions to Advent of Code 2022](https://github.com/lubomirkurcak/aoc2022).

I would be very happy for anyone to try this library, just have the understanding not much thought went into making it intuitive. Feel free to ping me, open issues or contribute. It would be neat if you found something from here useful!
